<!-- broken handling of Elasticsearch major version for Python library -->

Largest and most advanced collection of unified production-grade Nagios monitoring code in the wild.

Largest collection of Hadoop & NoSQL monitoring code, written by a former Clouderan ([Cloudera](http://www.cloudera.com) was the first Hadoop Big Data vendor).

Hadoop and extensive API integration with all major Hadoop vendors ([Hortonworks](http://www.hortonworks.com), [Cloudera](http://www.cloudera.com), [MapR](http://www.mapr.com), [IBM BigInsights](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibm-biginsights-for-apache-hadoop)).

Extends a variety of [compatible Enterprise Monitoring Systems](https://github.com/harisekhon/nagios-plugins#enterprise-monitoring-systems), can also be used standalone on the command line, in scripts etc.

Most enterprise monitoring systems come with basic generic checks, while this project extends their monitoring capabilities significantly further in to advanced infrastructure, application layer, APIs etc.

It's a treasure trove of essentials for every single "DevOp" / sysadmin / engineer, with extensive goodies for people running Web Infrastructure,
[Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/),
[Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/),
[RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/),
[Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/),
[Consul](https://www.consul.io/)
and NoSQL technologies [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/),
[HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/),

##### Make sure you run ```make update``` if updating and not just ```git pull``` as you will often need the latest library submodules and probably new upstream libraries too.

### Quick Start ###

1. a) Compile dependencies for executing locally by running ```make```  
      OR  
   b) Download pre-built via Docker
2. Execute each program on the command line with ```--help``` to see its options

#### Ready-to-run Docker image #####

All plugins and their pre-compiled dependencies can be found ready-to-run on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/harisekhon/nagios-plugins/).

List all plugins:
```
docker run harisekhon/nagios-plugins
```
Run any given plugin by suffixing it to the ```docker run``` command:
```
docker run harisekhon/nagios-plugins check_ssl_cert.pl --help
```

#### Automated Build from Source

```

git clone https://github.com/harisekhon/nagios-plugins

cd nagios-plugins

make

```

Some plugins like `check_yum.py` can be copied around independently but most newer more sophisticated plugins require the co-located libraries I've written so you should ```git clone && make``` on each machine you deploy this code to or just use the Docker [pre-built container](https://hub.docker.com/r/harisekhon/nagios-plugins) which has all plugins and dependencies inside.

You may need to install the GNU make system package if the ` make ` command isn't found (` yum install make ` / ` apt-get install make `)

To build just the Perl or Python dependencies for the project you can do ` make perl ` or ` make python `.

If you only want to use one plugin, you can do ` make perl-libs ` or ` make python-libs ` and then just install the potential one or two dependencies specific to that one plugin if it has any, which is much quicker than building the whole project.

` make ` builds will install yum rpms / apt debs dependencies automatically as well as a load of Perl CPAN & Python PyPI libraries. To pick and choose what to install follow the [Manual Build](https://github.com/harisekhon/nagios-plugins#manual-build) section instead

This has become quite a large project and will take at least 10 minutes to build. The build is automated and tested on RHEL / CentOS 5/6/7 & Debian / Ubuntu systems. The automated build also works on Mac OS X but will not handle basic OS system package dependencies for Mac.

Make sure /usr/local/bin is in your ` $PATH ` when running make as otherwise it'll fail to find ` cpanm `

The automated build will use 'sudo' to install required Perl CPAN & Python PyPI libraries to the system unless running as root or it detects being inside Perlbrew or VirtualEnv. If you want to install some of the common Perl / Python libraries such as Net::DNS and LWP::* using your OS packages instead of installing from CPAN / PyPI then follow the [Manual Build](https://github.com/harisekhon/nagios-plugins#manual-build) section instead.

If wanting to use any of ZooKeeper znode checks for HBase/SolrCloud etc based on check_zookeeper_znode.pl or any of the check_solrcloud_*_zookeeper.pl programs you will also need to install the zookeeper libraries which has a separate build target due to having to install C bindings as well as the library itself on the local system. This will explicitly fetch the tested ZooKeeper 3.4.8, you'd have to update the ```ZOOKEEPER_VERSION``` variable in the Makefile if you want a different version.

```
make zookeeper
```
This downloads, builds and installs the ZooKeeper C bindings which Net::ZooKeeper needs. To clean up the working directory afterwards run:
```
make clean-zookeeper
```

### Usage --help ###

All plugins come with `--help` which lists all options as well as giving a program description, often including a detailed account of what is checked in the code. You can also find example commands in the `tests/` directory.

Some common options also support optional environment variables for convenience to reduce repeated switch usage or to hide them from being exposed in the process list. These are indicated in the `--help` descriptions in brackets next to each option eg. `$HOST`, `$PASSWORD` or more specific ones with higher precedence like `$ELASTICSEARCH_HOST`, `$REDIS_PASSWORD` etc.

Make sure to run the [automated build](https://github.com/harisekhon/nagios-plugins#automated-build-from-source) or install the required Perl CPAN / Python PyPI modules first before calling `--help`.

### A Sample of cool Nagios Plugins in this collection ###

##### Hadoop
- ```check_hadoop_*.pl``` - various Apache Hadoop monitoring utilities for HDFS, YARN and MapReduce (both MRv1 & MRv2) including HDFS cluster balance, block replication, space, block count limits per datanode / cluster total, node counts, dead Datanodes/TaskTrackers/NodeManagers, blacklisted TaskTrackers, unhealthy NodeManagers, Namenode & JobTracker / Yarn Resource Manager heap usage, NameNode & JobTracker HA, NameNode safe mode, WebHDFS (with HDFS HA failover support), HttpFS, HDFS writeability, HDFS fsck status / last check / run time / max blocks, HDFS file / directory existence & metadata attributes, gather metrics and JMX information
- ```check_hbase_*.pl``` - various HBase monitoring utilities using Thrift + Stargate APIs, checking Masters / Backup Masters, RegionServers, table availability (exists, is enabled, and has minimum number of column families), number of expected table regions, unassigned table regions, regions stuck in transition, region count balance across RegionServers, compaction in progress (by table and by regionserver), number of regions in transition, longest current region migration time, hbck status and any inconsistencies, cell content vs optional regex + thresholds, table write and read back of unique generated values with write/read/delete latency checks against all detected column families, table write spray and read back of unique values across all regions for all column families with write/read/delete latency checks, gather metrics
- ```check_ambari_*.pl``` - Hadoop cluster checks via Hortonworks Ambari API - checks the service status, node(s) status, stale configs, cluster alerts summary, host alerts summary, cluster health report, kerberos enabled, cluster version, service config compatible with stack and cluster
- ```check_cloudera_manager_*.pl``` - Hadoop cluster checks via Cloudera Manager API - checks states and health of cluster services/roles/nodes, management services, config staleness, Cloudera Enterprise license expiry, Cloudera Manager and CDH cluster versions, utility switches to list clusters/services/roles/nodes as well as list users and their role privileges, fetch a wealth of Hadoop & OS monitoring metrics from Cloudera Manager and compare to thresholds. Disclaimer: I worked for Cloudera, but seriously CM collects an impressive amount of metrics making check_cloudera_manager_metrics.pl alone a very versatile program from which to create hundreds of checks to flexibly alert on
- ```check_mapr*.pl``` - Hadoop cluster checks via MapR Control System API - checks services and nodes, MapR-FS space (cluster and per volume), volume states, volume block replication, volume snapshots and mirroring, MapR-FS per disk space utilization on nodes, failed disks, CLDB heartbeats, MapR alarms, MapReduce mode and memory utilization, disk and role balancer metrics. These are noticeably faster than running equivalent maprcli commands (exceptions: disk/role balancer use maprcli).
- ```check_ibm_biginsights_*.pl``` - Hadoop cluster checks via IBM BigInsights Console API - checks services, nodes, agents, BigSheets workbook runs, dfs paths and properties, HDFS space and block replication, BI console version, BI console applications deployed
- ```check_apache_drill_*``` - check Apache Drill status and metrics for a given node, apply thresholds to a given metric or return multiple or all metrics
- ```check_atlas_*.py``` - Apache Atlas status and entity checks including entity existence, state=ACTIVE, expected type, expected tags are assigned to entity (eg. PII - important because Ranger ACLs to allow or deny access to data can be assigned based on tags)
- ```check_hiveserver2_llap_*.py``` - HiveServer2 LLAP Interactive server status and uptime, peer count, check for a specific peer host fqdn via regex
- ```check_zookeeper.pl``` - ZooKeeper server checks, multiple layers: "is ok" status, is writable (quorum), operating mode (leader/follower vs standalone), gather statistics
- ```check_zookeeper_*znode*.pl``` - ZooKeeper znode checks using ZK Perl API, useful for HBase, Kafka, SolrCloud, Hadoop NameNode HA & JobTracker HA (ZKFC) and any other ZooKeeper based service. Very versatile with multiple optional checks including data vs regex, json field extraction, ephemeral status, child znodes, znode last modified age

Attivio, Blue Talon, Datameer, Platfora, Zaloni plugins are also available for those proprietary products related to Hadoop.

##### NoSQL
- ```check_elasticsearch_*.pl``` - Elasticsearch cluster state, shards, replicas, number of nodes & data nodes online, shard and disk % balance between nodes, single node ok, specific node found in cluster state, pending tasks on a node, elasticsearch / lucene versions, per index existence / shards / replicas / settings / age, stats per cluster / index / node
- ```check_solr*.pl``` - checks for Solr and SolrCloud including API write/read/delete, arbitrary Solr queries vs num matching documents, API ping, Solr Core Heap / Index Size / Number of Docs for a given Solr Collection, and thresholds in ms against all Solr API operations as well as perfdata for graphing, as well as SolrCloud ZooKeeper content checks for collection shards and replicas states, number of live nodes in SolrCloud cluster, overseer, SolrCloud config and Solr metrics.
- ```check_cassandra_*.pl / check_datastax_opscenter_*.pl``` - Cassandra and DataStax OpsCenter monitoring, including Cassandra cluster nodes, token balance, space, heap, keyspace replication settings, alerts, backups, best practice rule checks, DSE hadoop analytics service status and both nodetool and DataStax OpsCenter collected metrics
- ```check_memcached_*.pl``` - Memcached API writes/reads/deletes with timings, check specific key's value against regex or value range, number of current connections, gather statistics
- ```check_riak_*.pl``` - Riak API writes/reads/deletes with timings, check a specific key's value against regex or value range, check all riak diagnostics, check node states, check all nodes agree on ring status, gather statistics, alert on any single stat
- ```check_redis_*.pl``` - Redis API writes/reads/deletes with timings, check specific key's value against regex or value range, replication slaves I/O, replicated writes (write on master -> read from slave), publish/subscribe, connected clients, validate redis.conf against running server to check deployments or remote compliance checks, gather statistics, alert on any single stat

##### Publish - Subscribe / Message Queues
These programs check these message brokers end-to-end via their API, by acting as both a producer and a consumer and checking that a unique generated message passes through the broker cluster and is received by the consumer at the other side successfully. They report the publish, consumer and total timings taken, against which thresholds can be applied, and are also available as perfdata for graphing.
- `check_kafka.pl / check_kafka.py` - Kafka brokers API write & read back with configurable topics/partition and producer behaviour for acks, sleep, retries, backoff, can also lists topics and partitions
- `check_redis_publish_subscribe.pl` - Redis publish-subscribe API write & read back with configurable subscriber wait
- `check_rabbitmq*.py` - RabbitMQ brokers AMQP API write & read back with configurable vhost, exchange, exchange type, queue, routing key, durability, RabbitMQ 'confirms' protocol extension & standard AMQP transactions support. Checks via the RabbitMQ management API include aliveness queue health test, built-in health checks, cluster name, vhost, exchange with optional validation of exchange type (direct, fanout, headers, topic) and durability (true/false), user auth and permissions tags, stats db event queue
<!--
Debian / Ubuntu systems also have other unrelated RabbitMQ plugins in the `nagios-plugins-rabbitmq` package
-->

##### Infrastructure
- ```check_ssl_cert.pl``` - SSL expiry, chain of trust (including intermediate certs important for certain mobile devices), SNI, domain, wildcard and multi-domain support validation
- ```check_whois.pl``` - check domain expiry days left and registration details match expected
- ```check_puppet.rb``` - thorough, find out when Puppet stops properly applying manifests, if it's in the right environment, if it's --disabled, right puppet version etc
- ```check_aws_s3_file.pl``` - check for the existence of any arbitrary file on AWS S3, eg. to check backups have happened or _SUCCESS placeholder files are present for a job
- ```check_dns.pl``` - advanced DNS query checker supporting NS records for your public domain name, MX records for your mail servers, SOA, SRV, TXT as well as A and PTR records. Can optionally specify `--expected` literal or `--regex` results (which is anchored for security) for strict validation to ensure all records returned are expected and authorized. The record, type and result(s) are output along with the DNS query timing perfdata for graphing DNS performance
- `check_disk_write.pl` - canary write test, catches partitions getting auto-remounted read-only by Linux when it detects underlying storage issues (often caused by malfunctioning block devices, raid arrays, failing disks)
- `check_git_branch_checkout.p*` - if deploying from a git checkout (eg. puppetmaster), make sure it stays on the expected branch otherwise you could auto-deploy the wrong stuff
- `check_consul_*.py` - Consul API write / read back, arbitrary key-value content checks, number of cluster peers & version
- ```check_mesos_*.pl``` - Mesos master health API, master & slaves state information including leader and versions, activated & deactivated slaves, number of Chronos jobs, master & slave metrics
- ```check_mysql_query.pl``` - flexible free-form SQL queries - can check almost anything - obsoleted a dozen custom MySQL plugins and prevented writing many more. You may also be interested in [Percona's plugins](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-plugins/latest/index.html)
- ```check_mysql_config.pl``` - detect differences in your /etc/my.cnf and running MySQL config to catch DBAs making changes to running databases without saving to /etc/my.cnf or backporting to Puppet. Can also be used to remotely validate configuration compliance against a known good baseline
- `check_linux_*` - checks RAM used, CPU context switches, system file descriptors, interface errors / promiscous mode / duplex / speed / MTU / stats, load normalized per CPU core (more useful than the default check_load plugin which would need different configs for heterogenous hardware), timezone settings, users / groups present (eg. PAM/LDAP integration is working), duplicate UID/GIDs (helps detects rogue uid 0 accounts and more common LDAP vs local id range overlap misconfigurations), groups.allow contains only specific groups
- `older/check_*raid.py` - RAID controller / array checks for 3ware, LSI MegaRaid / Dell PERC controllers (they're rebranded from LSI), and Linux software MD Raid. I also recommend the widely used [Dell OpenManage Check](http://folk.uio.no/trondham/software/check_openmanage.html)
- `check_ssh_login.pl` - performs a full SSH login with username & password, good for testing your Dell DRAC / HP iLO infrastructure is properly secured and accessible. Also works for your Linux servers and even Mac OSX
- ```check_travis_ci_last_build.py``` - checks the last build status of a given Travis CI repo showing build number, build duration with optional thresholds, start/stop date/time, if there are currently any builds in progress and perfdata for graphing last build time and number of builds in progress. Verbose mode gives the commit details as well such as commit id and message
- `check_*_version*` - checks running versions of software, primarily written to detect version inconsistency across clusters of servers and failed/partial upgrades across large automated infrastructures, as well as containerized images are using the versions we expect, which is also used to validate which versions of software programs in this repo are tested against. `check_cluster_version.pl` can be used to tie together versions returned from many different servers (by passing it their outputs via Nagios macros) to ensure a cluster is all running the same version of software even if you don't enforce a particular `--expected` version on individual systems
- ```check_yum.py / check_yum.pl``` - widely used yum security updates checker for RHEL 5 - 7 systems dating back to 2008. You'll find forks of this around including NagiosExchange but please re-unify on this central updated version. Also has a Perl version which is a newer straight port with nicer more concise code and better library backing as well as configurable self-timeout. For those running Debian-based systems like Ubuntu see `check_apt` from the `nagios-plugins-basic` package.

... and there are many more plugins than we have space to list here, have a browse!

This code base is under active development and there are many more cool plugins pending import.

##### Compatability / Translation Plugins

These allow you to use any standard nagios plugin with other non-Nagios style monitoring systems by prefixing the nagios plugin command with these programs, which will execute and translate the outputs:

- `check_mk_wrapper.py` - executes and translates output from any standard nagios plugin to Check_MK local plugin format
- `geneos_wrapper.py / csv_wrapper.py` - executes and translates output from any standard nagios plugin to Geneos / CSV format

### See Also

- ```find_active_server.py``` - returns the first available healthy server or determines the active master in high availability setups. Configurable tests include socket, http, https, ping, url with optional regex content match and is multi-threaded for speed. Useful for pre-determining a server to be passed to tools that only take a single ```--host``` argument but for which the technology has later added multi-master support or active-standby masters (eg. Hadoop, HBase) or where you want to query cluster wide information available from any online peer (eg. Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ clusters). This is downloaded from my [PyTools repo](https://github.com/harisekhon/pytools#hari-sekhon-pytools) as part of the build and placed at the top level. It has the ability to extend any nagios plugin to support multiple hosts in a generic way, eg:

```
./check_elasticsearch_cluster_status.pl --host $(./find_active_server.py --http --port 9200 node1 node2 node3)
```

### Kerberos Security Support ###

For HTTP based plugins Kerberos is implicitly supported by LWP as long as the LWP::Authen::Negotiate CPAN module is installed (part of the automated ```make``` build). This will look for a valid TGT in the environment and if found will use it for SPNego.

### Quality ###

Most of the plugins I've read from [Nagios Exchange](https://exchange.nagios.org/) and Monitoring Exchange (now [Icinga Exchange](https://exchange.icinga.org/)) in the last decade have not been of the quality required to run in production environments I've worked in (ever seen plugins written in Bash with little validation, or mere 200-300 line plugins without robust input/output validation and error handling, resulting in "UNKNOWN: (null)" when something goes wrong - right when you need them - then you know what I mean). That prompted me to write my own plugins whenever I had an idea or requirement.

That naturally evolved in to this, a relatively Advanced Collection of Nagios Plugins, especially when I began standardizing and reusing code between plugins and improving the quality of all those plugins while doing so.

##### Goals #####

- specific error messages to aid faster Root Cause Analysis
- consistent behaviour
- standardized switches
- strict input/output validation at all stages, written for security and robustness
- code reuse, especially for more complex input/output validations and error handling
- multiple `--verbose` levels & `--debug` mode
- `--warning/--critical` thresholds with range support, in form of `min:max` (`@` prefix inverts to expect value outside of this range)
- support for use of `$USERNAME` and `$PASSWORD` environment variables as well as more specific overrides (eg. `$MYSQL_USERNAME`, `$REDIS_PASSWORD`) to give administrators the option to avoid leaking `--password` credentials in the process list for all users to see
- self-timeouts
- graph data ([PNP4Nagios](https://docs.pnp4nagios.org/) add-on auto-graphs the perfdata from these plugins)
- [continuous integration](https://travis-ci.org/HariSekhon/nagios-plugins) with tests for success and failure scenarios:
  - unit tests for the custom supporting [perl](https://github.com/harisekhon/lib) and [python](https://github.com/harisekhon/pylib) libraries
  - [functional tests](https://github.com/HariSekhon/nagios-plugins/tree/master/tests) for the top level programs using [Dockerized containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/harisekhon/) for each technology (eg. Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Hadoop, HBase, ZooKeeper, Memcached, Neo4j, MongoDB, MySQL, Riak, Redis...)
- easy rapid development of new high quality robust Nagios plugins with minimal lines of code

Several plugins have been merged together and replaced with symlinks to the unified plugins bookmarking their areas of functionality, similar to some plugins from the standard nagios plugins collection.

Some plugins such as those relating to Redis and Couchbase also have different modes and expose different options when called as different program names, so those symlinks are not just cosmetic. An example of this is write replication, which exposes extra options to read from a slave after writing to the master to check that replication is 100% working.

Perl ePN optimization is not supported at this time as I was running 13,000 production checks per Nagios server years ago (circa 2010) without ePN optimization - it's not worth the effort and isn't available in any of the other languages anyway.

Python plugins are all pre-byte-compiled as part of the automated build.

##### Contributions #####

Patches, improvements and even general feedback are welcome in the form of GitHub pull requests and issue tickets.

Examples of your usage and outputs are also welcome for the Wiki as some of these plugins allow a great diversity of checks to be created - for example, free form MySQL queries or ZooKeeper contents checks can be used to check pretty much anything that advanced DBAs and applications/operations personnel can think of with a just a few command line --switches.

##### Libraries #####

Having written a large number of Nagios Plugins in the last 10 years in a variety of languages (Python, Perl, Ruby, Bash, VBS) I abstracted out common components of a good robust Nagios Plugin program in to libraries of reusable components that I leverage very heavily in all my modern plugins and other programs found under my other repos here on GitHub, which are now mostly written in Perl or Python using these custom libraries, for reasons of both concise rapid development and speed of execution.

These libraries enables writing much more thoroughly validated production quality code, to achieve in a quick 200 lines of Perl or Python what might otherwise take 2000-3000 lines to do properly (including some of the more complicated supporting code such as robust validation functions with long complex regexs with unit tests, configurable self-timeouts, warning/critical threshold range logic, common options and generated usage, multiple levels of verbosity, debug mode etc), dramatically reducing the time to write high quality plugins down to mere hours and at the same time vastly improving the quality of the final code through code reuse, as well as benefitting from generic future improvements to the underlying libraries.

This gives each plugin the misleading appearance of being very short, because only the some of the very core logic of what you're trying to achieve is displayed in the plugin itself, mostly composition of utility functions, and the error handling is often handled in custom libraries too, so it may appear that a simple one line field extraction or 'curl()' or 'open_file()' utility function call has no error handling at all around it but under the hood the error handling is handled inside the function inside a library, same for HBase Thrift API connection, Redis API connection etc so the client code as seen in the top level plugins knows it succeeded or otherwise the framework would have errored out with a specific error message such as "connection refused" etc... there is a lot of buried error checking code and a lot of utility functions so many operations become one-liners at the top level instead of huge programs that are hard to read and maintain.

I've tried to keep the quality here high so a lot of plugins I've written over the years haven't made it in to this collection, there are a lot still pending import, a couple others `check_nsca.pl` and `check_syslog-ng_stats.pl` are in the `more/` directory until I get round to reintegrating and testing them with my current framework to modernize them, although they should still work with the tiny utils.pm from the standard nagios plugins collection.

I'm aware of Nagios::Plugin but my libraries have a lot more utility functions and I've written them to be highly convenient to develop with.

###### Older Plugins ######

Some older plugins may not adhere to all of the criteria above so most have been filed away under the `older/` directory (they were used by people out there in production so I didn't want to remove them entirely). Older plugins also indicate that I haven't run or made updates to them in a few years so they're in basic maintenance mode and may require minor tweaks or updates.

If you're new remember to check out the `older/` directory for more plugins that are less current but that you might find useful such as RAID checks for Linux MD Raid, 3ware / LSI MegaRaid / Dell Perc Raid Controllers (which are actually rebranded LSI MegaRaid so you can use the same check - I also recommend the widely used [Dell OpenManage Check](http://folk.uio.no/trondham/software/check_openmanage.html)).

### Manual Build ###

Fetch my library repos which are included as submodules (they're shared between this and other repos containing various programs I've written over the years).

```

git clone https://github.com/harisekhon/nagios-plugins

cd nagios-plugins

git submodule init

git submodule update

```

Then install the Perl CPAN and Python PyPI modules as listed in the next sections.

##### Perl CPAN Modules #####

If installing the Perl CPAN or Python PyPI modules via your package manager or by hand instead of via the [Automated Build From Source](https://github.com/harisekhon/nagios-plugins#automated-build-from-source) section, then read the 'requirements.txt' and 'setup/cpan-requirements.txt' files for the lists of Python PyPI and Perl CPAN modules respectively that you need to install.

###### Net::ZooKeeper (for various ZooKeeper content checks for Kafka, HBase, SolrCloud etc) ######

```
check_zookeeper_znode.pl
check_zookeeper_child_znodes.pl
check_hbase_*_znode.pl
check_solrcloud_*_zookeeper.pl
```

The above listed programs require the Net::ZooKeeper Perl CPAN module but this is not a simple ```cpan Net::ZooKeeper```, that will fail. Follow these instructions precisely or debug at your own peril:

```
# install C client library
export ZOOKEEPER_VERSION=3.4.8
[ -f zookeeper-$ZOOKEEPER_VERSION.tar.gz ] || wget -O zookeeper-$ZOOKEEPER_VERSION.tar.gz http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.apache.org/zookeeper/zookeeper-$ZOOKEEPER_VERSION/zookeeper-$ZOOKEEPER_VERSION.tar.gz
tar zxvf zookeeper-$ZOOKEEPER_VERSION.tar.gz
cd zookeeper-$ZOOKEEPER_VERSION/src/c
./configure
make
sudo make install

# now install Perl module using C library with the correct linking
cd ../contrib/zkperl
perl Makefile.PL --zookeeper-include=/usr/local/include/zookeeper --zookeeper-lib=/usr/local/lib
LD_RUN_PATH=/usr/local/lib make
sudo make install
```
After this check it's properly installed by doing
```perl -e "use Net::ZooKeeper"```
which should return no errors if successful.

### Other Dependencies ###

Some plugins, especially ones under the older/ directory such as those that check 3ware/LSI raid controllers, SVN, VNC etc require external binaries to work, but the plugins will tell you if they are missing. Please see the respective vendor websites for 3ware, LSI etc to fetch those binaries and then re-run those plugins.

The ```check_puppet.rb``` plugin uses Puppet's native Ruby libraries to parse the Puppet config and as such will only be run where Puppet is properly installed.

The ```check_logserver.py``` "Syslog to MySQL" plugin will need the Python MySQL module to be installed which you should be able to find via your package manager. If using RHEL/CentOS do:

```
sudo yum install MySQL-python
```

or try install via pip, but this requires MySQL to be installed locally in order to build the Python egg...
```
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install MySQL-python
```

#### Configuration for Strict Domain / FQDN validation ####

Strict validations include host/domain/FQDNs using TLDs which are populated from the official IANA list. This is done via the [Lib](https://github.com/harisekhon/lib) and [PyLib](https://github.com/harisekhon/pylib) submodules for Perl and Python plugins respectively - see those repos for details on configuring to permit custom TLDs like ```.local``` or ```.intranet``` (both already supported by default as they're quite common customizations).

### Updating ###

Run ```make update```. This will git pull and then git submodule update which is necessary to pick up corresponding library updates.

If you update often and want to just quickly git pull + submodule update but skip rebuilding all those dependencies each time then run ```make update-no-recompile``` (will miss new library dependencies - do full ```make update``` if you encounter issues).

#### Testing

There is a full suite of Dockerized functional tests in the [tests/](https://github.com/HariSekhon/nagios-plugins/tree/master/tests) directory as well as a high coverage percentage of unit tests for the underlying [Perl library](https://github.com/harisekhon/lib) and [Python library](https://githu.com/harisekhon/pylib).

Running ```make test``` will trigger all tests, starting with the underlying libraries and then moving on to the Dockerized functional test suites.

##### Bugs & Workarounds #####

###### Kafka dependency NetAddr/IP/InetBase autoload bug ######

If you encounter the following error when trying to use ```check_kafka.pl```:

```Can't locate auto/NetAddr/IP/InetBase/AF_INET6.al in @INC```

This is an upstream bug related to autoloader, which you can work around by editing ```NetAddr/IP/InetBase.pm``` and adding the following line explicitly near the top just after ```package NetAddr::IP::InetBase;```: 

```use Socket;```

On Linux this is often at ```/usr/local/lib64/perl5/NetAddr/IP/InetBase.pm``` and on Mac ```/System/Library/Perl/Extras/<version>/NetAddr/IP/InetBase.pm```.

You may also need to install Socket6 from CPAN.

This fix is now fully automated in the Make build by patching the ```NetAddr/IP/InetBase.pm``` file and always including Socket6 in dependencies.

Alternatively you can try the Python version ```check_kakfa.py``` which works in similar fashion.

###### MongoDB dependency Readonly library bug ######

The MongoDB Perl driver from CPAN doesn't seem to compile properly on RHEL5 based systems. PyMongo rewrite was considered but the extensive library of functions results in better code quality for the Perl plugins, it's easier to just upgrade your OS to RHEL6.

The MongoDB Perl driver does compile on RHEL6 but there is a small bug in the Readonly CPAN module that the MongoDB CPAN module uses. When it tries to call Readonly::XS, a MAGIC_COOKIE mismatch results in the following error:
```
Readonly::XS is not a standalone module. You should not use it directly. at /usr/local/lib64/perl5/Readonly/XS.pm line 34.
```
The workaround is to edit the Readonly module and comment out the ```eval 'use Readonly::XS'``` on line 33 of the Readonly module.

This is located here on Linux:
```
/usr/local/share/perl5/Readonly.pm
```

and here on Max OS X:
```
/Library/Perl/5.16/Readonly.pm
```

###### IO::Socket::SSL doesn't respect ignoring self-signed certs in recent version(s) eg. 2.020 #####

Recent version(s) of IO::Socket::SSL (2.020) seem to fail to respect options to ignore self-signed certs. The workaround is to create the hidden touch file below in the same top-level directory as the library to make this it include and use Net::SSL instead of IO::Socket::SSL.

```
touch .use_net_ssl
```

#### Python SSL certificate verification problems

If you end up with an error like:
```
[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:765)
```
It can be caused by an issue with the underlying Python + libraries due to changes in OpenSSL and certificates. One quick fix is to do the following:
```
pip uninstall -y certifi && pip install certifi==2015.04.28
```

### Support for Updates / Bugs Fixes / Feature Requests ###

Please raise a [Github Issue ticket](https://github.com/harisekhon/nagios-plugins/issues) for if you need updates, bug fixes or new features.

Since there are a lot of programs covering a lot of different technologies in this project, so remember to look at the software versions each program was written / tested against (documented in --help for each program, also found near the top of the source code in each program). Newer versions of software seem to change a lot these days especially in the Big Data & NoSQL space so plugins may require updates for newer versions.

Please make sure you have run ```make update``` first to pull the latest updates including library sub-modules and build the latest CPAN / PyPI module dependencies, (see [Quick Setup](https://github.com/harisekhon/nagios-plugins#quick-setup) above).

Make sure you run the code by hand on the command line with ```-v -v -v``` for additional debug output and paste the full output in to the issue ticket. If you want to anonymize your hostnames/IP addresses etc you may use the ```scrub.pl``` tool found in my [Tools repo](https://github.com/harisekhon/tools).

### Enterprise Monitoring Systems

The following enterprise monitoring systems are compatible with this project:

* [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/) - the original widely used open source monitoring system that set the standard
  * [Nagios Command Configuration](http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/3_0/objectdefinitions.html#command)
  * [Nagios Service Configuration](http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/3_0/objectdefinitions.html#service)
  * [NRPE - Nagios Remote Plugin Executor](https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nrpe/NRPE.pdf) - most plugins check network services like NoSQL datastores but you can use NRPE for plugins that check the local system eg. `check_linux_*` / `older/check_*raid*.py`)

* [Icinga](https://www.icinga.org/) - a newer alternative to classic Nagios

* [Sensu](https://sensuapp.org/) - another modern Nagios compatible alternative

* [Shinken](http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/) - a Nagios core reimplementation in Python

* [Check_MK](http://mathias-kettner.com/check_mk.html) - Nagios-based monitoring solution with rule-based configuration, service discovery and agent-based multi-checks integrating [MRPE - MK's Remote Plugin Executor](https://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_mrpe.html)

* [Geneos](https://www.itrsgroup.com/products/geneos-overview) - proprietary non-standard monitoring, was used by a couple of banks I worked for. Geneos does not follow Nagios standards so integration is provided via ```geneos_wrapper.py``` which if preprended to any standard nagios plugin command will execute and translate the results to the CSV format that Geneos expects, so Geneos can utilize any Nagios Plugin using this program.

* [Microsoft SCOM](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/system-center) - Microsoft Systems Center Operations Manager, can run Nagios Plugins as arbitrary Unix shell scripts with health/warning/error expression checks, see the [documentation](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj126087(v=sc.12).aspx).

##### Datameer

Datameer plugins referenced in [Datameer docs](https://www.datameer.com/documentation/current/Home) from version 3 onwards in the Links section along with the official Nagios links. See here for more information on Datameer monitoring with Nagios:

* https://www.datameer.com/documentation/current/Monitoring+Hadoop+and+Datameer+using+Nagios

After trying the 1 example plugin there, return to try the 9 plugins in this collection to extend your Datameer monitoring further.
